# yolo-object-detection

This repository provides an implementation of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that identifies multiple objects in images and video streams efficiently. This project serves as a comprehensive guide for using YOLO in various applications, including real-time surveillance, autonomous driving, and mor
